[h2]this mod adds content, no restrictions.[/h2]

no set theme - any addition or change is fair game so long as i want to create it!

i try my best to make sure attention is given to details and take care to make content feel at home in Terraria while giving it my own spin.

current content in Everware is short and simple, including two interchangeable world structures of which you get one per world: the Kiln and the Quarry. each has its own small set of crafted gear, a custom theme, and carefully-tuned extra visual details.

[b]once downloaded, check the mod's in-game description for more details![/b]
